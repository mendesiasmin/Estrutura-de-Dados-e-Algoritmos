Rule: Whenever that finds a house place a base 4 miles away far from it then walks more 4 miles.
Repeat the procedure by finding houses ahead. 

// P = Positions of the house


few_bases(P,end) 

   int i = 0
    
   while( p < end) // while p not reaches road end

        
        p <-- P[i] // position of the house i

        p <-- p + 8 // walks 8 miles
        
        bases++ // place a base 4 miles behind

        while ( P[++i] < p ) // Places i in the next house after p

   end      

   return bases

end
