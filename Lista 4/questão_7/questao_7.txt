// JOBS = job set
// n = number of jobs and minimal PCs
// p = processing time in the super computer
// f = time that takes to finishes a job on the PC

Schedulling_jobs(jobs, n) 

   Sj // scheduled jobs

   Sort jobs in decrescent order of their finishing time f

   for i beginning at 0 to (n - 1)
 
        schedule job(i) to Sj

    end

    return Sj
end
