Rule: Always add the student with the maximum number of overlaped shifts to add to comiteee

// S = Set of shifts of each student
// n = number of shifts
// C = Comitee set

Comitee(S, n)
    
    // C comitee set

    while S is not empty 

        for i beginnning at 0 to (n-1)
    
            c = shift that overlaps the maximum number of shifts

        end


        add c to C
        remove c and his overlapping shifts from S
    end
    
    return C
    

end

 
Justificative: To minimizes the number of students on the comitee, we must maximize
the number of students that are supervisioned by a single supervisioner.
