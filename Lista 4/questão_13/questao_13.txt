Given a set of n jobs, each one taking t seconds to finish and a weight w associated.

// Jobs is the set of jobs to be completed
// n is the number of total jobs
// t is the time that a jobs takes to complete.
// C is the acumulated time of each job. ex: C2 = C1 + t2

scheduling_jobs(Jobs, n)

    Sj // Scheduled jobs

    sort the jobs in crescent order of (t*w);

    for i begining at 0 to (n - 1)
        
        schedule job(i) to Sj

    end 

    return Sj
end


Justificative: The completion time Ci depends on the Ci-1 and ti, that is, Ci = Ci-1 + ti. Well, the question asks for minimizes 
the overall sum Ci*wi, with Ci = Ci-1 + ti. At each iteration, the Ci becomes greater because it has to add Ci-1+ti. But we already know that if we have two numbers,
for example t2 and t3. with t3 > t2 and we add some constant, in this case, Ci-1, the inequality remains. So, 
at each iteration, we only have to find the lesser ti*wi.
